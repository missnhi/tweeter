## Features of Tweeter
1.  Realistic Writing Speed:\
    The app simulates a realistic typing effect when users write tweets, enhancing the user experience.
2.  Form Validation:\
    The tweet submission form includes validation to ensure that tweets meet certain criteria (e.g., character limits) before being submitted.
3.  Dynamic Rendering and Fetching with AJAX:\
    Tweets are dynamically rendered on the page without requiring a full page reload. This is achieved using AJAX to fetch and display new tweets.
4.  Responsive Design:\
    The app is designed to be responsive, ensuring it works well on various devices and screen sizes.
5.  SASS for Styling:\
    The app uses SASS for styling, allowing for the use of variables, nested styles, and mixins to maintain clean and manageable CSS.
6.  User Avatars:\
    Each tweet includes a user avatar, adding a personal touch to the tweets.
7.  Character Counter:\
    A character counter is included in the tweet form to help users keep track of the tweet length and ensure it stays within the allowed limit.
8. "WOW" by Owen Wilson will play everytime a tweet is posted.
